# Titanic Survival Analysis

A data analysis project exploring passenger survival patterns using Python.

## Dataset

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

- **train.csv**: 891 passengers with survival labels
- **test.csv**: 418 passengers for predictions
- **gender_submission.csv**: Sample submission format

## Analysis

The project examines three key aspects of survival for now:

1. **Age Analysis** (`age_analysis.py`) - Survival rates by age groups
2. **Family Analysis** (`family_analysis.py`) - Impact of family size on survival
3. **Survival Analysis** (`survival_analysis.py`) - Gender and age demographics

## Key Findings

- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men
- Children under 12 had the best survival chances
- Small families (2-4 people) survived better than solo travelers
- Passenger class strongly influenced survival outcomes
